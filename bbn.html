Nelson after an 7 minutes challenge defeated the other 19 housemates to become this week's head of house.

Big Brother's challenge saw all 19 housemates trying to get Peebles from an oil-stained bucket of water with a peg. The four housemates with the highest amount of pebbles removed from the bucket unto the plate qualified for the next level.


<br>
At the end of the first stage KimOprah had 4 Peebles, Mike had 5, Jackye: 2, Jeff: 1, Tacha:6, Diane: 3, Omashola: 6, Khafi: 8, Gedoni: 1, Mercy: 10, Ike: 8, Seyi: 7, Thelma: 5, Nelson: 8, Frodd: 6, Sir Dee: 2, Ella: 2 and Esther: 3. However, Tuoyo was disqualified from the game for touching the peebles.
<br>
With these results, Mercy, Ike, Khafi, and Nelson moved to the next stage. The next stage involved the housemates forming a tower with cookies. This game began at the sound of the buzzer and ended in 2 minutes. The twist to this stage was that all cookies were to remain standing after 30 seconds.</h4>
