						 <h4>Electoral Act: Saraki takes on Buhari</h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/download.jpg" alt="" /></span>Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki has urged President Muhammadu Buhari not to heed the advice of anti-democratic elements who are putting pressure on him not to give assent to the 2018 Electoral Bill.


Saraki in a statement in Ilorin on Wednesday signed by his Special Adviser (Media and Publicity), Yusuph Olaniyonu, urged the President to rise above petty politics and act without further delay in the best interest of the country and its democracy by signing the Electoral Bill into law.

Saraki noted that he had been inundated with telephone calls and discussions by members of the National Assembly who expressed concern about the delay in the signing into law of the Electoral Bill as the one month period provided by the law for the President to sign a bill presented to him by the National Assembly is about to expire in the next few days.


Saraki added that many of the legislators who contacted him were particularly disturbed that certain individuals who are said to be chairmen of political parties had approached the Federal High Court to stop the President from assenting to the bill.

He noted that the jaded tactic employed in the 90s to scuttle the return to democracy when groups like the Association for Better Nigeria (ABN) went to court to frustrate the announcement of the results of the June 12, 1993 elections was now being adopted by some masked groups and individuals to stop the signing into law of the Electoral Bill.

Saraki urged President Buhari to dissociate himself from these ugly antics and sign the bill which he said has comprehensively addressed issues that usually clog the process of free, fair, credible and peaceful elections.


“It is the prerogative of the President to either sign a Bill into law or refuse it assent. He is free to exercise this prerogative the way he likes in this case. What I found surprising is a situation where some people now want to adopt a wrong tactic of abusing the court process to stall the matter. That will be unacceptable and I am sure our judiciary will rely on the lessons from the past and not allow itself to be used.

“We do not want the President to allow the setting of a bad precedent in which somebody will go to court in future to stop the passage of an appropriation bill or any essential law which will be important to the development of the country.

“My position remains that the President, his aides, the entire country and the international community are aware that all the concerns raised by the President on the past three occasions he withheld assent to the bill have been addressed by the legislature. We bent backwards on each occasion to accommodate the wishes of the President. We started work on this law since 2016 to prevent a situation where it would become part of the election controversies.

“Every sincere commentator, observer and analyst knows that what we have done with that bill is to raise the level of transparency, credibility and acceptability of our electoral process. We made sure that the law if assented to and honestly applied by INEC and all those concerned will give us an election that will be better than what we had in 2015.

“The President should know that the survival of democracy, its development and the future of Nigeria are far more important than the ambition of any individual or party. I am using this opportunity to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to put a stop to this uncertainty in the political process by signing without delay the 2018 Electoral Bill so as to allow INEC and the concerned parties know how to prepare for a credible process”, Saraki stated.

						<h4>Smith accuses police of collecting houses from criminals, drug bandits as bribe</h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/buhari's.jpg" alt="" /></span>A former Inspector-General of Police and Chairman, Police Service Commission, Musiliu Smith, Wednesday, disclosed to the Senate that the rot in the Police Force had got to a head as criminals and drug bandits give gift of houses to serving policemen.

Smith made the allegation during a public hearing on a ‘Bill for an Act to repeal the Police Act CaP P19 Law of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 and enact the Police Act, 2018’, which held at the National Assembly complex.

The hearing which was attended by the topmost echelon of the Police formation and other relevant institutions of government and individuals, was conducted by Senate Committee on Police Affairs.

Also, Smith opposed plans by the Senate to expunge ‘Force’ from the name of the organisation and retain only Nigeria Police, saying that it must be done appropriately, in line with the provisions of the constitution.

He averred that since what is contained in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is “Nigeria Police Force”, and not Nigeria Police, it had become imperative for the National Assembly to first amend the Constitution before reflecting it in the bill, else, the name should be allowed as captured in the Constitution.

Besides, he further observed that the Police was poorly funded, a situation he said, was responsible for the poor performance of the institution in discharging its constitutional responsibility of maintaining law and order and protecting lives and property of citizens.

It was on this premise that the former Police boss canvassed for better funding of the Police, stressing that the annual budgetary provisions for the Force was usually grossly inadequate, and would never allow the agency to carry out its duties diligently.

In his words, “I have few observations. One is the name from Nigeria Police Force to Nigeria Police. If the name has to be changed, it has to be done constitutionally. We met a police when all the training schools were working. We met a police where you could not be promoted without writing an examination.

“We met a police where every policeman lived in the barracks. Some policemen are given houses by criminals and hard drug bandits. That need to change. We should think of additional funding source for the police.

“In Lagos State, a governor came into office. He didn’t like what he met on ground. He invited some of us to change what was on ground. That was what gave birth to Lagos State Police Trust Fund. We can’t tackle insecurity without this. Let us think of that. The annual yearly budget ritual can’t help. It will not take us anywhere. If you want a highly motivated Police Force, we should adequately fund it”.

Also, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr. Ibrahim Idris, opposed plans by the Senate to pass the bill seeking to make it compulsory for the apex legislative assembly to confirm the appointment of an IGP by the President.

Idris even killed led against parts of the proposed bill which would empower the Senate to remove the IGP whenever it deemed it necessary, saying that such provision was unnecessary and would politicise the Force.

Suffice it to say that this was the first time the IGP was appeared before any Senate Panel after his refusal to appear before the Senate earlier in the year.

In the amendment bill, the Senate Committee is also proposing to reduce the number of Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG) from seven to one but Idris expressed opposition to the idea, saying that the reduction would make the job hectic for the IGP.

In his words, “You can’t police a people without their consent. The provisions of the Bill are in consonance with the contents of the Criminal Justice System. The confirmation and removal of the IGP by the Senate is not necessary. It will politicise the Police Force. It should be expunged from the Bill. The tenure of the IGP of five years should be maintained.

“The appointment of the IGP in consultation with Police Service Commission is appropriate. There should not be any confirmation by the Senate. This is the desire and position of the Police Force. There should not be one DIG. There should be seven as we have already. Having one will put too much pressure on the IGP. Having seven reduces the workload.”

						<h4>Kanye West calls out Drake, Tyson, Nick Cannon over ‘negative’ comments on Kim Kardashian </h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Kanye-West.jpg" alt="" /></span>Popular American rapper, Kanye West has called our Drake Nick Cannon and Tyson Beckford over an alleged negative statement made about his wife, Kim Kardashian.


Kanye West in videos on his Instagram page warned the trio to stop saying negative things about Kim Kardashian henceforth.

Speaking on his issues with Nick Cannon, he said:” I’m out of the sunken place, I can be Ye and express how I feel, there’s a couple of things that I want to address. First of all, I wanna address Nick Cannon. I understand that you used to date my wife, but [when] you get in an interview, don’t mention my wife. If someone brings up my wife, you say, ‘Ye, I respect that man. I’m not speaking on that.'”

</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/download%20(1).jpg"  alt="" /></span>West addressing Drake said, “If I wasn’t in a medicated state, I would have had the wherewithal to say, ‘Hey Pusha, don’t diss Drake on my beat and I spoke about that and took accountability for that.
“The fact that people are making rumours that you fucked my wife and you not saying nothing and you carrying it like that, that doesn’t sit well with my spirit.”
He also stated how he believes Drake’s usage of “Kiki” from his single “In My Feelings” was directed at his wife.
“You know, if I had a girlfriend from Chicago and her name was Ranita and then you was married to Rihanna, I wouldn’t make no song called ‘Riri.’ So when you’re like, ‘Oh, I don’t know where it come from, you’re too smart for that, bro. You know where that come from. Don’t make no record with nothing that can be confused.”
Lastly, West switched his comments at model Tyson Beckford,saying “As far as Tyson Beckford goes, don’t speak on my wife, bro. None of you all should speak on my wife.

“Nick Cannon, Drake, Tyson Beckford all that negativity does not sit right with me, that’s why I had to address it like this.”</p>

						<h4>SWAEC: Fayose reacts to Buhari’s results attestation, tells Nigerians what to do </h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/nlc.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Kogi State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Comrade Onuh Edoka, says it is unfortunate that the state government is still not sure of its actual monthly wage bill, after over two years of a screening exercise that is still ongoing.


Edoka, who spoke on Saturday, said, “the state government does not know what the state wage bill looks like and are not too sure of the activities of those preparing her wage bill, and now wants to use the table payment to ascertain the true figures.

” The Kogi state government is only using the table payment to investigate those preparing the salaries of workers, when it discovered that the wage bill couldn’t have gone up even after a tortuous screening exercise that brought hardship on the workers”.


Edoka said it is a common knowledge that salaries are no longer prepared by accountants in ministries and parastatals, but rather by the accountant-general and auditor-general, who pay from a single source from government house in Lokoja.

In his words, “It was clearly an argument of labour at the discussion table that the N2.8billion figures as monthly wage bill of government was on the high side after two years of screening that saw many people lose their jobs, with several others cleared and yet to be returned on the pay roll.

” While at the discussion table, labour engaged the government that what it inherited from the immediate past administration was N2.6billion as monthly wage bill. We expressed our reservations on why the wage bill would still be going up, yet with many workers no longer on the payroll.


“Labour never made suggestions for table payment but rather it only challenged the bogus wage bill of the state which it felt unrealistic.

” When we met at the discussion table, the government through it financial management team said they will pay three and four months salaries to core ministries and tertiary institutions respectively.

” We now asked what was the total implication of the amount they want to pay from the money received by the government. They now said the total amount to be paid was N9.7billion, with the state monthly wage bill standing at N2.8billion.

” We now told them that the monthly figure was outrageous most especially that it inherited N2.6billion from past administration. We wondered why the wage bill is this high when several persons have lost job, and others are still not on the payroll since the screening began over two years ago.”

The NLC chairman, however, urged those who are defrauding the state using the Kogi State wage bill, to have a rethink, warning that such practices was only joepadizing the future of Kogites and the people.</p>

						<h4>Kogi govt still doesn’t know state’s wage bill despite two years of screening workers – NLC </h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Ayodele-Fayose-3-1025.webp" alt="" /></span>The immediate past governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has reacted to issuance of the attestation of school result from the West African Examination Council, WAEC to President Muhammadu Buhari.


DAILY POST recalls that Buhari had been under attack after he failed to submit his credentials to the Independent National Electoral Commission ahead of the 2019 elections.

Buhari only submitted an affidavit wherein he claimed that his credentials were with the Secretary to the Military Board.


However, Buhari on Friday received the attestation his school results from the West African Examination Council, WAEC, and displayed it online to Nigerians.

This, however, did not douse doubts surrounding the certificate saga as some Nigerians queried the authenticity of the attestation.

Fayose, on his part, questioned why it took so long for Buhari to receive the document.


The former governor, while describing the controversy surrounding Buhari’s WAEC certificate as embarrassment to the country, urged Nigerians to vote out the president in 2019.

Fayose, on his Twitter page, wrote: “If it was this easy to get WAEC to issue the “Attestation/Confirmation Certificate, why waiting this long? Why contesting four times without a single certificate? So when will the military produce the credentials that he claimed are with them? Many questions begging for answers.

“My consolation is that (provided they will allow votes to count) Nigerians will have the opportunity of ending this national embarrassment in four months time.

“I have never seen a nation that has been so embarrassed by a mere question of; “Mr President, where are your credentials?”</p>
