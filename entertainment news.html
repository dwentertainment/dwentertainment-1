						 <h4>Fresh Revelations That Naira Marley Isn’t A First Time Offender Emerges</h4>

During the arraignment on Monday at the Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos, a member of his defense counsel, Taiwo Oreagba pleaded with Hon. Justice I.N Oweibo, the Judge presiding over the case that the singer is remanded in EFCC custody till the day of his bail hearing.

Oreagba had said Naira Marley was a first time offender.

However, A news website in London, Newsshopper on the 11th of June 2014, had reported that Naira Marley, with four other men, was declared wanted by Lewisham Police for various crimes ranging from robbery to sexually harassing people on night buses.


 
Naira Marley, who was 19-years-old at that time was published wearing a black T-shirt and a swollen left eye with a caption that read: “Azeez Fashola, 19, is wanted by police in connection with an incident in Surrey Canal Road, New Cross on March 5.”

						<h4>SWAEC: Fayose reacts to Buhari’s results attestation, tells Nigerians what to do </h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/nlc.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Kogi State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Comrade Onuh Edoka, says it is unfortunate that the state government is still not sure of its actual monthly wage bill, after over two years of a screening exercise that is still ongoing.


Edoka, who spoke on Saturday, said, “the state government does not know what the state wage bill looks like and are not too sure of the activities of those preparing her wage bill, and now wants to use the table payment to ascertain the true figures.

” The Kogi state government is only using the table payment to investigate those preparing the salaries of workers, when it discovered that the wage bill couldn’t have gone up even after a tortuous screening exercise that brought hardship on the workers”.


Edoka said it is a common knowledge that salaries are no longer prepared by accountants in ministries and parastatals, but rather by the accountant-general and auditor-general, who pay from a single source from government house in Lokoja.

In his words, “It was clearly an argument of labour at the discussion table that the N2.8billion figures as monthly wage bill of government was on the high side after two years of screening that saw many people lose their jobs, with several others cleared and yet to be returned on the pay roll.

” While at the discussion table, labour engaged the government that what it inherited from the immediate past administration was N2.6billion as monthly wage bill. We expressed our reservations on why the wage bill would still be going up, yet with many workers no longer on the payroll.


“Labour never made suggestions for table payment but rather it only challenged the bogus wage bill of the state which it felt unrealistic.

” When we met at the discussion table, the government through it financial management team said they will pay three and four months salaries to core ministries and tertiary institutions respectively.

” We now asked what was the total implication of the amount they want to pay from the money received by the government. They now said the total amount to be paid was N9.7billion, with the state monthly wage bill standing at N2.8billion.

” We now told them that the monthly figure was outrageous most especially that it inherited N2.6billion from past administration. We wondered why the wage bill is this high when several persons have lost job, and others are still not on the payroll since the screening began over two years ago.”

The NLC chairman, however, urged those who are defrauding the state using the Kogi State wage bill, to have a rethink, warning that such practices was only joepadizing the future of Kogites and the people.</p>

						<h4>Kogi govt still doesn’t know state’s wage bill despite two years of screening workers – NLC </h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Ayodele-Fayose-3-1025.webp" alt="" /></span>The immediate past governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has reacted to issuance of the attestation of school result from the West African Examination Council, WAEC to President Muhammadu Buhari.


DAILY POST recalls that Buhari had been under attack after he failed to submit his credentials to the Independent National Electoral Commission ahead of the 2019 elections.

Buhari only submitted an affidavit wherein he claimed that his credentials were with the Secretary to the Military Board.


However, Buhari on Friday received the attestation his school results from the West African Examination Council, WAEC, and displayed it online to Nigerians.

This, however, did not douse doubts surrounding the certificate saga as some Nigerians queried the authenticity of the attestation.

Fayose, on his part, questioned why it took so long for Buhari to receive the document.


The former governor, while describing the controversy surrounding Buhari’s WAEC certificate as embarrassment to the country, urged Nigerians to vote out the president in 2019.

Fayose, on his Twitter page, wrote: “If it was this easy to get WAEC to issue the “Attestation/Confirmation Certificate, why waiting this long? Why contesting four times without a single certificate? So when will the military produce the credentials that he claimed are with them? Many questions begging for answers.

“My consolation is that (provided they will allow votes to count) Nigerians will have the opportunity of ending this national embarrassment in four months time.

“I have never seen a nation that has been so embarrassed by a mere question of; “Mr President, where are your credentials?”</p>
