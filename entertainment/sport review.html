Former Arsenal Winger, Reyes Dies In Car Crash
Sevilla Football Club has confirmed the death of ex-Arsenal and Spain attacker Jose Antonio Reyes in a car crash.

The former Sevilla academy graduate also had spells at Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, China and second-tier Spanish club Extremadura. He was 35 years old.


 
“We couldn’t be confirming worse news. Beloved Sevilla star Jose Antonio Reyes has died in a traffic collision. Rest in peace,” Sevilla, where he spent two four-year spells, said on Twitter.

The emergency services in Andalusia and the authorities in the player’s home town, Utrera, said Reyes died in an accident on the main road from Sevilla to Utrera. They said another member of his family also died and a third person was injured.

Man Utd Set To Beat Arsenal To PSG Defender
Manchester United are closing in on a £22m deal to sign Thomas Meunier after fending off interest from Arsenal to land the Paris Saint-Germain right-back, according to Belgian outlet DH.be.


 
Unai Emery is in the market for a new right-back to compete with Hector Bellerin as Stephan Lichtsteiner and Carl Jenkinson are expected to leave the Emirates this summer while Ainsley Maitland-Niles is more comfortable playing in midfield.

Meunier emerged as a prime target and Gazzetta Dello Sport journalist Nicolo Schira claimed on Friday that Arsenal were in advanced talks with PSG to secure a deal after offering the full-back a five-year contract.

U.S. coach Tab Ramos made just one change to the starting XI from his side’s opening 1-2 loss against Ukraine, and their 2-0 win was enough to drop the Flying Eagles one place from the group’s apex position.

An unmarked Soto nodded home Alex Mendez’s corner-kick service at the far post in the 18th minute, giving the U.S. a 1-0 lead.


 
Less than one minute into the second half Soto snuck past the Nigeria defence yet again, doubling his team’s advantage.

Nigeria were not without their chances, leaving the U.S. scrambling from a flurry of brilliant individual efforts towards the end of the first half.

In the end the U.S. held on to greatly lift their chances of advancing from Group D.


 
NAN reports that with this result both Nigeria and the U.S. have three points after two matches each, with one win and one loss each.

Ukraine who had earlier in the day defeated Qatar 1-0 however lead the group with six points from two wins after two games.

Nigeria are in second place ahead of the U.S. on goals difference, with Qatar in fourth place</p><center><footer><a href="sport%20video.html">view video &raquo;</a></footer></center>
